Reproducing analysis as described in "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Müller and Guido

## Scope
Ambitious I know, but for the moment I only intend to following along with Chapter 7 since my immediate needs are in natural language processing.  

Nothing new will be included in this repo that doesn't appear in the book.  Sorry.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks for Müller and Guido who wrote the book from which I'm working.

# followingMullerGuido
Reproducing analysis as described in "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Müller and Guido

![](https://github.com/manifolded/followingMullerGuido/blob/master/Images/coverArt.jpg?raw=true)

## Scope
Ambitious I know, but for the moment I only intend to following along with Chapter 7 since my immediate needs are in natural language processing.  

Nothing new will be included in this repo that doesn't appear in the book.  Sorry.

## Chapter 7
`Scikit-Learn Approach` - follow instructions on page 332 to download reviews data analyzed in this chapter.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks for Müller and Guido who wrote the book from which I'm working.

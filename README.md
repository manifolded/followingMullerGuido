Reproducing analysis as described in "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Müller and Guido

![](https://github.com/manifolded/followingMullerGuido/blob/master/Images/coverArt.jpg?raw=true)

## Scope
Ambitious I know, but for the moment I only intend to following along with Chapter 7 since my immediate needs are in natural language processing.  

Nothing new will be included in this repo that doesn't appear in the book.  Sorry.

## Chapter 7
`Scikit-Learn Approach.ipynb` - Follow instructions on page 332 to download reviews data analyzed in this chapter.  Allow it to be placed in a `./data` directory which is where the notebooks will look for it.  For obvious reasons the data files have not been commited to this repo.  You have to download them separately.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Müller and Guido who wrote the book from which I'm studying.
